description: "Due to the widespread use of <table> elements across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers, Bootstrapâ€™s tables are opt-in. Add the base class .table to any <table>, then extend with our optional modifier classes or custom styles. All table styles are not inherited in Bootstrap, meaning any nested tables can be styled independent from the parent."
